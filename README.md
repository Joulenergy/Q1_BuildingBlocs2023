# Q1_BuildingBlocs2023
By Ayden, Joulene and Theophilus

An AI web app using Flask that does mental health screening and diagnosis. :D <br>

# How to run
1) Download this repository.
2) Download sts_bert_model.pth *seperately* (The model downloaded in step 1 does not work for some reason)
3) Replace the downloaded in step 1 with the one downloaded in step 2.
4) Run flask_app.py to run the Flask app.

*DISCLAIMER: After the chatbot asks you 10 questions, it will have to process your responses for ~4 minutes to give a diagnosis. Please be patient if it hangs! :)*
